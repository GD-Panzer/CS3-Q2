		<h1>General Strategy</h1>
		<p>After you have assembled your empire, what to do now? You go for victory types, but this is not the section you should be looking at right now if your looking for that. This is about a generalist strategy on the midgame to lategame.</p>
		<p> Basicly, what I like to do in the mid to late game is just build up an average miltary force from scratch, make cites better with buildings and tile improvements, and just make my empire look good. I also recomend b-lining production and making as much world wonders as you can because they give specific bonuses to your empire that help you in the long run. An example would be the Great Wall of China, this world wonder gives enemy units heavy terrain penalties when in your territory, making it harder for them to invade. I personally do this almost all the time because most win conditions for me is in the lategame, so I have to go for a generalist set.</p>
