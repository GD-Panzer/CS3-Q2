			<h1>Victory types</h1>
			<div>
				<h3>Domination</h3>
				<p>In vanilla and Gods & Kings, you achieve a domination victory if you are the last player in possession of your original capital. You do not have to wipe out all other players entirely! It doesn't matter who controls the other Capital Capitals: you can, for example, let another player take all the other Capital Capitals but yours and then take their Capital Capital, at which point you win immediately. Also, if two other players capture each other's original capitals, you will win the game even if you weren't at war with either of them.</p>
				<p>Note that the original capital of a civilization can never be completely destroyed; it can only be captured (unless you play the "One City Challenge"). If your Capital Capital is captured, another one of your cities will be assigned as the current capital. The current capital can, however, be destroyed and does not count towards the domination victory.In Brave New World, you must control all opposing players' original capitals and be in possession of your own original capital to achieve a domination victory.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Science</h3>
				<p>To achieve a science victory, you must build and launch a spaceship. In order to do this, you need first to complete the Apollo Program project, and then you must reach far enough in the technology tree to be able to build the components of the spaceship. All of the necessary technologies for this are in the Information Era (Modern and Future Eras in vanilla), and require developing practically the entire tech tree.</p>
				<p>Once you have all the required components of the spaceship (or as they become available), you can assemble them at your Capital Capital. The spaceship will be automatically launched to Alpha Centauri once assembled. In Brave New World, it appears that the tech development in the later eras has been considerably slowed (more Science Science required for each tech), probably to allow for a longer time to play with all new late-game features introduced in the expansion.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Cultural</h3>
				<p>Cultural victory is achieved by filling out five trees of social policies and completing the Utopia Project. Each tree has 5 policies, so in order to win you must have acquired 25 social policies in 5 different policy trees.Social policies are acquired with Culture Culture, with the cost increasing for each new one. Also, founded and annexed cities increase the amount of Culture Culture needed depending on map size, which makes this path very hard for large empires. To work around this issue, you can limit the foundation of new cities and, when capturing other players' cities, you can make them puppets instead of annexing them.</p>
				<p>In the Brave New World expansion pack, cultural victory conditions change dramatically, and have been replaced with what is best described as a "Cultural Domination" victory. The task is to use the new Tourism Tourism game mechanics to influence all other civilizations still in game and achieve at least the Influential level of cultural influence with each one.Based upon the difference between a civ's Tourism Tourism and others' Culture Culture, there are six possible stances: Unknown, Exotic, Familiar, Popular, Influential, and Dominant. The difficulty is increasing your cultural influence from Tourism Tourism with other civilizations while simultaneously protecting your own civilization from their influence using Culture Culture.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Diplomatic</h3>
				<p>Diplomatic victory is achieved by winning a vote in the United Nations. To win the vote, you must have the majority vote, and in order to gather more votes, players can become allies with city-states, or return captured cities to defeated AI players.</p>
				<p>The player who built the United Nations first has two votes instead of the usual one, giving them an extra edge when voting. Every civilization leader will vote for another civilization that liberated his capital (in which case this leader will get the vote). City-states will vote only if they are allied with a civilization or a civilization liberated them in the past, so a common way of winning would be allying with the required number of city-states on the turn just before the UN vote occurs.</p>
				<p>The Brave New World expansion makes changes to the diplomacy feature. The United Nations is not a buildable wonder anymore - instead it develops automatically from the World Congress when a civilization reaches the Information Era or at least half of the world's civilizations reach the Atomic Era. At that point, a new automatic vote starts every 20 turns: the vote for the World Leader. The conditions for winning this vote are pretty much the same as for winning the vote for any other resolution, except for a minimum number of votes required is based on number of civilizations and city-states.
