		<h1>2nd City Settling</h1>
		<p>After you settle the capital, where next? I would say to start making another settler to expand your empire even more. Now where to place it? I would personally place it a semi far-away distance from the capital (around 8 tiles away). I would recomend placing the city next to a mountain and have that city bomb rush great scientists. This is because observatories give a +50% science output which is pretty sizeable. Personally, I haven't used this strat a lot because I can't find a good mountain to settle most of the time. I would also recomend doing the thing I did with the capital with your 2nd to onwards city. It has a good balance between not to strategy specific and being fine</p>
