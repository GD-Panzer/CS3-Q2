			<h1>Capital Settling</h1>
			<p>Your capital is the most important city in Civ 5. It generally has the most buildings out of every city. The problem is, where to optimally place it? (Conditions: 1 luxury resource and 1 strateigic resource near spawn point + river next to hill) Personally, I would settle the capital near the river on top of a hill. This is because being on a hill gives you a bonus to production in the early game, so much further expansion can be made, and a river has lots of unique structures that help in the growth and prodiction of that city.</p>
			<p>Another helpful thing to note is that being on a hill + next to a river gives you lots of defensive bonuses against attackers. A hill gives +25% defensive bonus to the city, while the river gives the attackers a 20% debuff from attacking across a river</p>
